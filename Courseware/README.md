## Courseware

This course is divided into three topic areas necessary to build successful
autonomous robotic systems. These are:
* <b>Introduction</b> to computer systems
* <b>Peripheral</b> support providing basic information and functionality
* <b>Application</b> of algorithms to create higher-level functionality

### Schedule

(picture of schedule.)
<center>Course Schedule</center>

Three weeks of the course are roughly divided into a week for each topic,
while the first week will also involve the assembly of the chosen
implementation (specified below.) The final week requires students to apply
what they have learned and built to compete in an autonomous robotics
competition.

### Implementation

The implementation chosen for instruction involves the <b>Introduction</b>
of the Raspberry Pi circuit board and robotic system assembly, <b>Peripheral
</b> interface with a GPS sensor, an IMU accelerometer and a motor
controller, and the <b>Application</b> of pathfinding and control system
algorithms.
